        <h1>Hej!</h1>
        <p>
            UX designer from Barcelona, based in Malm√∂. My latest achievements have been to 
            receive a diploma from the UX design institute. Throughout my course and previous 
            work as a graphic designer, I always put the end-user first, while following a 
            methodical process to build and deliver the best solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            After years as a Freelance Graphic designer I develop a love for typography and 
            the use of colour and space to create harmonious layouts. But my seek to expand my 
            knowledge by learning and create more meaningful design drive me to transition in 
            to UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being able to be the voice of the user  and embrace their needs is hugely important 
            to me as a designer. To do this it is essential to build empathy with your end user 
            and understanding their needs is the base for having a real impact in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mission is to provide a solution-based approach to solving problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I like losing myself in art museums, book stores or  coffee shops.
        </p>
