            <h3>What is Blink</h3>
            <p>
                Typicall when we go clothes shopping in a phyiscal store it's pretty straight
                forward to figure out what clothes you're interested in and not. Given that we
                are buying more and more online that experience of searching for clothes is 
                essential for ensuring a user is having a positive experience. Blink is a case
                study that seeks to find the pain points users face in product search and how we
                can fix
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                Firstly I set myself the task of understanding the basics that are generally 
                involved when people searching and buy online clothes.
            </p>
            <p>The context of the study and what I consider of is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The product I will focus is online retailer clothes web base 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The tasks of features I want to measure are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    E-commerce conventions
                </li>
                <li>How feedback is delivered to the user</li>
                <li>How the user can search for products</li>
                <li>How are the product descriptions displayed</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The e-commerce retail websites are about search products and apply filters in order to find it what the user need.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
