I always before starting to tackle a new project I invest time to define a UX project plan that will help me to think about how UX work will integrate with the broader project timeline.

{%capture point1%}
The first stage of my Human-centered design process is to gain empathy by understanding the problem I'm trying to solve.
Depending on the project requirement, I will carry out a competitive Benchmark, Online surveys, Usability testing sessions, Note-taking, and Interviews.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point2%}
During this stage, I will structure the data I gathered in order to get into the root of the problem through analysing and synthesising my observations.
I will use methods of collaboration sessions like Affinity Diagram we can share our findings, empathy maps, personas, and user journey map. Also Brainstorming and SCAMPER.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point3%}
Now I'm ready to generate ideas,  start to "think outside the box" to identify new solutions to the problem statement you’ve created, and you can start to look for alternative ways of viewing the problem.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point4%}
To avoid falling in love with my own ideas and building solutions that just aren’t right, I conduct further usability tests on my prototypes. I am over the moon when I can see that my designs are working, but I always keep an open mind and listen to what users have to say. Being precious about your designs is your worst enemy.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point5%}
With all the Problem statements and insight I adopt the solving mode, starting by creating sketching Once I am happy with the final iterations of my sketches, I design the medium or high fidelity screens and prototypes.

{%endcapture%}
{%capture point6%}
Having different software engineer friends, helped me to understand how complex can be interpret my ideas and prototypes. In order to achieve the best final product I invest time make sure that my annotated wireframes contain all the necessary detail a developer would need to build my designs accurately.

{%capture point7%}
Along this stage, I like be involved in order to assist the developer of is needed and also to don't miss the opportunity to learn more from them.
