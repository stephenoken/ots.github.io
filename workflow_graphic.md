I start my projects carry out conversations to set deadlines, budgets, possible formats for the final product and what options the printer can offer.

All my projects start with a Briefing, this is the foundation of the project, from this document I can learn about the client’s needs, the business and target.

Before starting to design goes full-throttle into a project, I run a brainstorm based on ideas, concepts, sketches. The outcome is to create at least 3 solid ideas but in low fidelity, that I will present to the client to decide on which one you want to move forward with.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point4%}
Throughout my initial presentation of 3 ideas, I show the client a low-fidelity version of the design, in the presentation, to choose which version we will focus on and refine. Sometimes I will have to go through the steps, explaining the decisions I made at each stage so that the client can understand his choices and why the design looks like this.

Feedback is the best piece of communication that the clients can offer to help bring your vision to life. This is potentially the most important part of the design process and working from empathy is key to hears and understands the client opinion and thoughts on what I have designed.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point6%}
With a chosen design version, the client's feedback and the entire previous search and brainstorming process, this is when I begin the itinerary process of refining the design until achieving a high definition version, where I include the final texts approved by the client, I generate versions of the logo and apply the mark to different formats.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point7%}
Now its time to prepare the last presentation, where one again I will present all the facts that suport my design desicions. Where I will link with the initial breafing and I will prepare all the high definition mockups with all the desgin variations and formats. In order to get the clients final aproval.
{%endcapture%}
{%capture point8%}
This will involve setting things like bleed, slug, crop and fold marks so it’s ready to be printed. Though, there are certain final specifications for all sorts of designs to ensure the best quality.
I will also prepare the working files for the company to be used for the team. Like the logotype and different versions, family fonts, images.
