                It is an e-commerce website that allows its users to consciously customize their search filter options
                to achieve a faster and more efficient user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast because they don't have to fill the filters over and over again.
                Effective because you can provide results that really align with the user's style.

            <p>
                As a starting point, I reviewed retail websites and I set myself the task of understanding the basics
                that are generally involved when people searching and buy online clothes..
            </p>
            <p>
                For this benchmark, I applied these measures:
            </p>
            <p>Cognitive Biases</p>
            <p>Patterns and Conventions</p>
            <p>Usability Heuristics</p>
            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The e-commerce retail websites are about search products and apply filters in order to find what the
                    user needs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>My thoughts</h4>
            <p>During my research, I came to realise that for a relatively simple task such as finding and buying a
                t-shirt. There are many solutions that exist across retail websites. This made me wonder how users are
                interacting with the different shopping experiences.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The first step was to define the purpose of the Survey. What I want to know to form the users and to
                    get
                    more valuable data about the user's Needs, Thoughts, Emotions, Motivations</p>
                <p>In order to get this data I was very thoughtful about how to ask the questions to get input I was
                    looking
                    for, and at the same time get quantitative and qualitative data.</p>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Users know what they are looking for on a website.</li>
                    <li>The experience of searching doesn't mean anything to them</li>
                    <li>They know well the process to the level that is not a challenge or a funny thing to do.</li>
                    <li>They want to save time and use the tools that make the searching more fast and effective. .</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>My thoughts</h4>
                <p>There's a lot of different opinions about the search process and the filters. But what about enjoying
                    the
                    experience?</p>

            </ul>
            <h4>My thoughts</h4>
            <p>The search bar tool provides very broad and un accurate results. Doesn't matter if the user is more
                precise in selecting the words, the results are unexpected and break the mental model and the user feels
                very confused. </p>

                During this phase, I reviewed the usability test I recorded. My mission was take the most detailed notes
                a possible, focusing on built the user empathy detecting the:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Needs, emotions, thoughts,motivations, what is said and what is done.

                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>My thoughts</h4>
            <p>Different search methods give very different results. By categories and filters it is the most accurate
                for the user, but also the one that consumes the most time. How can we make the search faster and more
                precise?</p>

            <p>The goal of this Journey map was to create a diagram that reveals exactly where the sites were helping
                visitors succeed—or letting them down.</p>
            <p>A customer journey map helps crystallize where customers get stuck or frustrated on their path to
                purchase and beyond. It’s a visual representation that synthesizes data on personas and user
                behaviour.</p>
            <p>In this step, I visualize two flows that I was able to identify during the usability testing. The journey
                maps are focus on one persona in one scenario. </p>
            <p>This map helps me to was to visualize the sequence of the events and identify the task and goals implied
                in each one. </p>
            <h4>Findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>

                    The search tool provides more random results. As we can see in picture 2, when the user has to
                    search
                    using that tool was unable to find the products and move to another website.
                </li>
                <li>

                    Besides the process is funny o enjoyable, if it's not efficient and helps the user to find the
                    product
                    and applying wisely the filters, all the process doesn't matter.

            <p>Visualizing user attitudes and behaviours in an empathy map helps me to align on a deep understanding of

                    till some external or internal drag the trill to buy.

                <li>
                    Using images or icons helps the user to find information.
                    Filters are widely used to narrow down search results.
                    It is always going to offer some content to users, or they will leave when they find nothing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Searching through the toolbar provides very random results. And after that step the user will use
                    the
                    filters.
