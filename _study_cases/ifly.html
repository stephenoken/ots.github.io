            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>
                Booking a flight through a mobile app can be a complex experience. 
                Through this case study I propose a booking flow with a 
                friction free experience.

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                This case study was my graduation project for the UX design institute. 
                Throughout this project I performed both the research and design process in order to 
                achieve the professional diploma.

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>
                To streamline the fare and flights selection I added a clear button 
                selection and strong visual feedback. To ensure the user get all the 
                information that need in each stage.

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
                This project gave me valuable insight into the UX process and what is 
                required of them. Also taught me the correct methodology and the right mindset 
                needed to be a thoughtful user advocate, and I have learend how to build 
                something usable and desirable, that creates a positive experience for the user.

            <p>
                The simplest part of planning a trip is deciding the destination. 
                A lot of users have problems during the booking process on an airline’s 
                mobile app, in order to book a flight is required to complete a set of 
                tasks in order to successfully book a flight. Ifly is an User center airline 
                app desingend to deliver a smooth booking experience.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The first step in the process is to analyse how competitors are solving the booking process.
                  I focused on three European airlines, two of which were short haul carriers and the 
                  other was a long haul carrier. I also analysed AirBnB as a travel related competitor. 
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Looking a flight is a highly structured process, where the user steps through a 
                    series of screens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Throughout these steps, the user is required to complete specific tasks such 
                    as selecting dates and filling out passenger forms
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                Across the airline industry there is a well defined process for booking flights, 
                so breaking that convention could backfire.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                In order to acquire more quantitative and qualitative data about the project, 
                I ran an online survey. Using both closed-ended and 
                open-ended questions I was able to collect useful data about user behaviour.
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Users prefer searching for flights on airline websites. </li>
                <li>Mobile apps are typically used for checking-in.</li>
                <li>Most users make short-distance trips.</li>
                <li>Users associate their travel experience with the in app experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                This process has helped me gain insight into how users use these types of apps.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                During this phase, I reviewed two usability test recordings that were provided by 
                the UX Institute. Each recording was of a user performing the task of booking a 
                flight in both the Aer Lingus and Eurowings apps. The test began with an in-depth 
                interview to give the user context. Throughout the interviews I took detailed notes 
                about the user’s goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Price and flight times are the main search criteria for users.</li>
                <li>
                    On the home screen of the apps, the intrusive advertising distracts 
                    the users from their goal of booking a flight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extra steps not well highlighted when selecting the breakdown of 
                    different fares. This breaks the user’s mental models of the flow.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                The selection of both the flight and the type of fare is a major pain 
                point for the user.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The next logical step was to perform a usability test. To acheive this,
                I recruited a friend who travels by air on a regular basis and books their
                flights online. I conducted the test remotely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the I did not have an existing product but was researching for a new one,
                Idecided to use two existing competitor apps instead. They were
                SAS and Norwegian apps. I prepared an in depth interview and test 
                to be completed within one hour. 
            </p>
            <b>Task To Complete:</b>
            <p>
                Book a flight for a City break. Fly from Copenhagen to Paris from November
                9th to 11th but flexible with departure dates. The trip is for two people.
                The flow stops before seat selection. 
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The SAS interface was less cluttered and that prevented the flow from being interrupted.</li>
                <li>
                    In the Norwegian app test, it was more challenging for the user to book a 
                    flight. There was confusion on selecting the flight and the fares, which 
                    were not clear. The user was getting lost at different points in the flow.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                The user had never used the SAS or Norwegian app before. But they still knew how 
                to navigate through them. This confirms that industry conventions are well known.

                This helped me at structure to the data collected in the previous steps.

            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The main goal of the Home screen is to start the flight search.</li>
                <li>Users get confused when navigating between the departure and return screens.</li>
                <li>It is important to inform if the selected flight is direct or has a layover.</li>
                <li>Selecting fares is confusing and the Compare Fares screen has too much information.</li>
                <li>Giving constant feedback helps users to stay in the flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                Working with someone else, we were able to take the unstructured data and clustered 
                it together into a structured format and then we were able to identify logical theme 
                patterns.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of the customer journey diagram was to continue shaping and structuring 
                the data previously obtained, and to create a visualisation. To achieve this, I put 
                myself in the mind of the user and attributed their positive and negative points to 
                each steps of the flow. 
            </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>
                From the customer journey diagram I now know the key user goals and more importantly 
                the common pain points and mental models that prevent the user from having a smooth 
                booking experience. They are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unexpected transition between departure and return flights.</li>
                <li>Selecting different fare types</li>
                <li>Unclear information about whether the flight is direct or not.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                Going through this process allowed me to understand that a user’s experience depends 
                on their goals. These goals are not always global and each step can have it’s own 
                mini goals. The mini goals can either improve or disimprove the user’s experience.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                The objective of this phase was to create a high level flow of the booking process. 
                For this project, my main focus was on one primary use case. To achieve this I 
                split the flow into more detailed tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, this process helped me to identify the main and sub screens. It also 
                informed me which screen the content will go on. 
            </p>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                This step allowed me to further organize the data I collected and I was able 
                to start designing a more concrete architecture for the booking process.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                At this point I began to develop a solution to the problem. This involved creating 
                sketches of the screens that would form part of my solution. To achieve the initial 
                design I followed the methodology below:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Using the flow diagram I identified the key screens I needed to design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a list of key features for each screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I focused on a single screen, where I put the user goal first. Then I 
                    took the feature list and sorted it by priority to achieve that goal. 
                    With these criteria  I made several variations that tried to solve 
                    this problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I reviewed each of these variations and I selected the one that best 
                    satisfies the user goal. And making sure that I included all the key features.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once I identified the best sketch for each screen. I brought the sketches together 
                    to validate that the solution satisfies the user’s end goal of booking a flight.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                By listing the key features and the user’s goal for each section, I was able to 
                design UI elements that have purpose in mind.

                With the sketches I was able to begin creating an interactive prototype of my solution. 
                This medium fidelity prototype focused on taking the sketches I created and making a 
                realistic and intuitive prototype. Where you can see how the end to end booking process 
                worked. At this point I didn’t focus on the theming or branding of the app, since I 
                wanted to focus on building recognizable UI elements with different states.

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
                This was the final project for my UX course. The focus here was to create a wireframe 
                that provided detailed information to the software engineers and other stakeholders on 
                how to build this solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the last project I had to do for the course. In it I included extra information, 
                such as the states of the buttons and form. Also extra to help navigate within the 
                figma file, as well as font and color systems.For its development I had to detail all 
                the information to hand over to the developers.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>
                To develop this wireframe I had to go through the entire flow. It was useful to reflect 
                on the work and see what could be further improved.

            As an extra step I decided to create a more realistic prototype. My focus was

            From creating this prototype I was able to identify areas of improvement within the solution. 
            As well as validate design decisions with the UI elements.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                I found that this project really highlighted to me the importance of how each stage 
                in the process 
                feeds into the next and how it informs my decision making throughout the process. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was interesting how I started with a very abstract problem of 
                just improving the booking experience. But as I worked through the process 
                I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the industry conventions when 
                it comes to booking a flight through the app. I was able to identify the user 
                goals, behaviours, pain points and context in those conventions and the actual 
                problem to solve.  Which was a rewarding experience.

            <p>
                If I were to continue working on this project, I would start doing usability tests 
                on the final prototype from this project and begin to further refine this solution.
