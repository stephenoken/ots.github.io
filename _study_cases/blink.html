            <p>
                This case study is a personal project where I will apply new learnings from the online platform
                Interaction Design Foundations and other self-learning research. Throughout this project, I performed
                both the research and design processes.

            <p>
                Provide a tool that users can deliberately choose between options designed to make the user experience
                more personal and also get better search results.

            <p>
                It is an e-commerce website that allows its users to consciously customize their search filter options
                to achieve a faster and more efficient user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast because they don't have to fill the filters over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Effective because you can provide results that really align with the user's style.

            <p>
                As a starting point, I reviewed retail websites and I set myself the task of understanding the basics
                that are generally involved when people searching and buy online clothes..
            </p>
            <p>
                For this benchmark, I applied these measures:
            </p>
            <p>Cognitive Biases</p>
            <p>Patterns and Conventions</p>
            <p>Usability Heuristics</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The e-commerce retail websites are about search products and apply filters in order to find what the
                    user needs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>During my research, I came to realise that for a relatively simple task such as finding and buying a
                t-shirt. There are many solutions that exist across retail websites. This made me wonder how users are
                interacting with the different shopping experiences.</p>

            <p>TThe first step was to define the purpose of the Survey. What I want to know to form the users and to get
                more valuable data about the user's Needs, Thoughts, Emotions, Motivations</p>
            <p>In order to get this data I was very thoughtful about how to ask the questions to get input I was looking
                for, and at the same time get quantitative and qualitative data.</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Users know what they are looking for on a website.</li>

                <li>They know well the process to the level that is not a challenge or a funny thing to do.</li>
                <li>They want to save time and use the tools that make the searching more fast and effective. .</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>There's a lot of different opinions about the search process and the filters. But what about enjoying the
                experience?</p>

            <h3>Questions</h3>

                <li>Is my navigational system really as intuitive as I think it is?</li>
                <li>Is my value proposition really as clear, concise and compelling as I think it is?</li>
                <li>Is my lead funnel simple and clear? Is the next step obvious and non-intimidating?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>The search bar tool provides very broad and un accurate results. Doesn't matter if the user is more
                precise in selecting the words, the results are unexpected and break the mental model and the user feels
                very confused. </p>

                During this phase, I reviewed the usability test I recorded. My mission was take the most detailed notes
                a possible, focusing on built the user empathy detecting the:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Needs, emotions, thoughts,motivations, what is said and what is done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    User goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>Different search methods give very different results. By categories and filters it is the most accurate
                for the user, but also the one that consumes the most time. How can we make the search faster and more
                precise?</p>

            <p>The goal of this Journey map was to create a diagram that reveals exactly where the sites were helping
                visitors succeed—or letting them down.</p>
            <p>A customer journey map helps crystallize where customers get stuck or frustrated on their path to
                purchase and beyond. It’s a visual representation that synthesizes data on personas and user
                behaviour.</p>
            <p>In this step, I visualize two flows that I was able to identify during the usability testing. The journey
                maps are focus on one persona in one scenario. </p>
            <p>This map helps me to was to visualize the sequence of the events and identify the task and goals implied
                in each one. </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>The search tool provides more random results. As we can see in picture 2, when the user has to search
                using that tool was unable to find the products and move to another website.</p>
            <p>Besides the process is funny o enjoyable, if it's not efficient and helps the user to find the product
                and applying wisely the filters, all the process doesn't matter.</p>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its
                effectiveness and simplicity.</p>

            <p>Visualizing user attitudes and behaviours in an empathy map helps me to align on a deep understanding of
                end-users. The mapping process also reveals some holes in existing user data, like the actual
                feelings and user mood during the experience. </p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>TThe actual online shopping process experience is not enjoyable. Users can apply a free flow, go and back
                till some external or internal drag the trill to buy. </p>
            <p>Users know well the steps, they repeat automatically.</p>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its
                effectiveness and simplicity.</p>

            <p>Having a good amount of data from my user research allowed me to collaborate with a friend to get to the
                root of my findings. During the affinity diagram session, we worked together to put structure on the
                large volume of qualitative data from my research.</p>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <p>Using images or icons helps the user to find information.
                Filters are widely used to narrow down search results.
                It is always going to offer some content to users, or they will leave when they find nothing.</p>
            <p>Searching through the toolbar provides very random results. And after that step the user will use the
                filters.</p>
            <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>
                How can we provide users with better results when looking for a product?
