CAS Beteiligungne GmbH was one of the clients I worked for during my time as 
a freelance designer working in Vitavo.

### Briefing 
Create a new style for the logotype and branding for company materials such as stationary.

### Goal
Develop a responsive branding that is modern, yet maintains the Art Deco style.

### Challenge 
The main priority for CAS was to create branding based on the Art Deco style. This style has strong 
visual characteristics.
