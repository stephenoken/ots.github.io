### Why have I used this methodology
At this point I began to develop a solution to the problem. This involved creating sketches of the screens that would form part of my solution. To achieve the initial design I followed the methodology below:

### Process
The main goal of these sketches was to flesh out different solutions until the best fit was found that would improve the user's overall experience

### Findings
* You would have to add more steps in the process, such as onboarding, to be able to explain the new system well.

### My hypothesis
If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its effectiveness and simplicity.
