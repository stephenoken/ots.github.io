### Why I used this methodology
To help me to align on a deep understanding of the end-user. To articulate what I know, find holes in the data. And also to help me to share this information for more collaborative Stages.
### Process
Visualizing user attitudes and behaviours in an empathy map helps me to align on a deep understanding of end-users. The mapping process also reveals some holes in existing user data, like the actual feelings and user mood during the experience.

#### Tasks to complete:
*  The actual online shopping process experience is not
enjoyable.
*  Users can apply a free flow, go and back till some external
or internal drag the trill to buy.  
* Users know well the steps, they repeat automatically.

### My hypothesis
If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its effectiveness and simplicity.
