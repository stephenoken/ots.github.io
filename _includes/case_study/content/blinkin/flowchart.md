### Why I used this methodology
To describe the back-end process and the user task flows. To map out the website flow and stages.
### Process

I built a User Flow that matches with the user's needs. The goal is to map user's paths from the entry page through the conversions funnels, towards the final actions.

### Bussines objetives:
Get users sing up, purchase products and join an email list.

### Users objetives:
Find the right product and do the check in as quick and save as possible .

### What did I find?
*  I was able to map out all the steps a user needs to take in  order to use the new custom feature. 
### My hypothesis
If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its effectiveness and simplicity.
