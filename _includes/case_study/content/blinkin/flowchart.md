### Why I used this methodology
To describe the back-end process and the user task flows. To map out the website flow and stages.
### Process

#### Tasks to complete:
Book a flight for a City break. Fly from Copenhagen to Paris from November 9th to 11th but flexible with departure dates. The trip is for two people. The flow stops before the seat selection.
I build a User Flow that matches with the user’s needs, the goal is to map user’s paths from the users' entry page through conversions funnels, toward the final actions providing value to both:

#### Business objectives:
Get users sign up, purchase products and join an email list.

#### Users objectives:
The first step in a flow is mapping out how they get to your site.

### What did I find?
*  I was able to map out all the steps a user needs to take in
order to use the new cosutme feature. 
### My hypothesis
If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its effectiveness and simplicity.
