### Why I used this methodology
To crystallize where customers get stuck or frustrated on their path to purchase and beyond. It’s a visual representation that synthesizes data on personas and user behaviour.
### Process
The goal of this Journey map was to create a diagram that reveals exactly where the sites were helping visitors succeed—or letting them down.

In this step, I visualize two flows that I was able to identify during the usability testing. The journey maps are focus on one persona in one scenario.
This map helps me to was to visualize the sequence of the events and identify the task and goals implied in each one.

#### Tasks to complete:
*  The search tool provides more random results. As we can see in picture 2, when the user has to search using that tool was unable to find the products and move to another website.

*  Besides, the process is funny o enjoyable, if it's not efficient and helps the user to find the product and applying wisely the filters, all the process doesn't matter.
### My hypothesis
If the experience does not create happiness, at least we are going to make it memorable for its effectiveness and simplicity.
