### Why I used this methodology
To gather relevant facts, for the problem statement

### Process
Review all the notes and paid attention to where the users feel the pain points.

### Findings
*  The main problems are focused on the search results. 

### My hypothesis
I will need to work on a solution for that stage, but don't forget what the others stage and section may need attention.
