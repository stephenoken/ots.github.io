Find a solution. I felt that I had to look for more ideas and ideas, but in the end I couldn't think of more. I would have liked to be able to share my discoveries and ideas with more UX designers in order to create a better product.

{%capture enjoyed%}
What I have enjoyed the most has been taking from 0 a sector that I only knew how to use and seeing myself able to dissociate myself from that mentality and put myself in the mind of a UX designer and see the experience from another point of view.

{%capture project_overview%}
I consider this study case in an ongoing stage. I'm just finishing the Build stage, and I will conduct a series of further usability tests to continue refining and improving the design.

My key takeaway was that trust the research and analysis process, listen to your users and don't be afraid to learn new insights you never know how you can apply to your work.
