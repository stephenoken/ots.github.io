### Why I used this methodology
A customer journey map helps me to crystallize where customers get stuck or frustrated on their path to purchase and beyond. Itâ€™s a visual representation that synthesizes data on personas and user behaviour.

### Process
Fueled by data-driven research I create a user persona representing one segment of the target audience in order to insights from user personas that can help improve copy, tailor targeting and inform product development to make informed decisions base on the persona and the research.
#### Tasks to complete:
*  Understand fundamental motivations:
Free shipping and free return policy.

*  Understand fundamental concerns:
The product is shipped to my country.



### My hypothesis
My user persona build based on my research is focused on the free charge shipping process, and that is something that escapes from my control. I'm on the right direction, but I need more participants.
