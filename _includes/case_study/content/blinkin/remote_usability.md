### Why I used this methodology
To learn about the user context, goals, behaviours. Also, to upskill how to conduct interviews and draw insights from the users.

### Process
To understand how real people experience and engage with the sites I ran a Usability Testing to show me their experience, where I can pick up on issues and insights they weren't even aware of.

#### Comparative usability testing perform in:
Zalando and H&M website.

#### Tasks to complete:
Search for a T-shirt for a casual party and add it to the basket. Zalando and H&M website.

### What did I find?
*  Is my navigational system really as intuitive as I think it is?
*  Is my value proposition really as clear, concise and    
compelling as I think it is?
*  Is my lead funnel simple and clear? Is the next step obvious   
and non-intimidating?

### My hypothesis
The search bar tool provides very broad and un accurate results. Doesn't matter if the user is more precise in selecting the words, the results are unexpected and break the mental model and the user feels very confused.
