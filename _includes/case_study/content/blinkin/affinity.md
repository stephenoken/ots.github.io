### Why I used this methodology

To review all the notes and insight I gather till now to organize the research findings from a large set of ideas into clusters working in collaboration, with the goal of creating awareness of usability issues and design challenges and to gain empathy towards the users. 

### Process
Having a good amount of data from my user research allowed me to collaborate with a friend to get to the root of my findings. During the affinity diagram session, we worked together to put structure on the large volume of qualitative data from my research.
### Findings
* Using images or icons helps the user to find information. 
* Filters are widely used to narrow down search results. 
* It is always going to offer some content to users, or they
will leave when they find nothing. 
* Searching through the toolbar provides very random
results. And after that step the user will use the filters

### My hypothesis
How can we provide users with better results when looking for a product?
