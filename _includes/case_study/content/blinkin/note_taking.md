### Why I used this methodology

To take notes to highlight the key insights observed, during the session and watching the recording. Also to create a bank of insights for the next stages.

### Process
During this phase, I reviewed the usability test I recorded. My mission was take the most detailed notes a possible, focusing on built the user empathy detecting the:

* Needs, emotions, thoughts,motivations, what said and what do.
And also the userâ€™s:
* Goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.

### Findings
*  What they are unable to find on your site.
*  What is missing from your site.
*  What is unclear or vague.
*  What is causing friction or preventing them from converting.
### My hypothesis
Different search methods give very different results. By categories and filters it is the most accurate for the user, but also the one that consumes the most time. How can we make the search faster and more precise?
