### Why I used this methodology

To evaluate the current online e-commerce by using metric relative to the performance and understand the standarts.

### Process
As a starting point, I reviewed retail websites and I set myself the task of understanding the basics that are generally involved when people searching and buy online clothes.

For this benchmark, I applied these measures:
*  Cognitive Biases
*  Patterns and Conventions
*  Usability Heuristics.

### Findings
* The e-commerce retail websites are about search
  products and apply filters in order to find what the user
  needs.
### My hypothesis
During my desk research, I came to realise that for a relatively simple task as finding and buying a t-shirt many different solutions exist across retail websites. This made me wonder how users are interacting with the different shopping experiences.
