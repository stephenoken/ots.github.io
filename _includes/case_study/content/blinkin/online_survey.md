### Why I used this methodology

It’s a easy way to gather a lot of  user data, its cheap and relatively fast .

### Process
The first step was to define the purpose of the Survey. What I want to know to form the users and to get more valuable data about the user's Needs, Thoughts, Emotions, Motivations

In order to get this data I was very thoughtful about how to ask the questions to get input I was looking for, and at the same time get quantitative and qualitative data.

### Findings
* The Users know what they are looking for on a website. 
* The experience of searching doesn't mean anything to them 
* They know well the process to the level that is not a challenge or  a funny thing to do. 
* They want to save time and use the tools that make the searching more fast and effective.
### My hypothesis
There's a lot of different opinions about the search process and the filters. But what about enjoying the experience?

"Because it helps you to limit your search to what you are exactly looking for and save time."|
"Well, it depends on the search. I use filters if there are too many options for a product and to select a clothing size. Otherwise, I normally don\'t to use filters."
