### Why I used this methodology

To evaluate the current online e-commerce by using metric relative to the performance and understand the standards.

### Process
As a starting point, I reviewed retail websites, and I set myself the task of understanding the basics that are generally involved when people searching and buy online clothes.

For this benchmark, I applied these measures:
*  Cognitive Biases
*  Patterns and Conventions
*  Usability Heuristics.

### Findings
* The e-commerce retail websites are about search
  products and apply filters in order to find what the user
  needs.
### My hypothesis
During my desk research, I came to realise that for a relatively simple task as finding and buying a t-shirt many different solutions exist across retail websites. This made me wonder how users are interacting with the different shopping experiences.

"Sometimes after apply the filers I don’t get any result or there’s no products, and I have to start again"|
"Because it helps you to limit your search to what you are exactly looking for and save time."|
"Well, it depends on the search. I use filters if there are too many options for a product and to select a clothing size. Otherwise, I normally don\'t to use filters."
