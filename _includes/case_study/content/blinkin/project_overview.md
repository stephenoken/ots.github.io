{%capture project_overview%}
Blinkin is an e-commerce website that allows its users to consciously customize their search filter options.
This case study is a personal project where I will apply new learnings from the online platform Interaction Design Foundations and other self-learning research.

{%capture problem%}
Currently, in an e-commerce website when users search for a product, the filters return results that are too broad.
The filtered information is vague and does not help the customer's decision to buy a product. Users want more accurate results when searching for a product, so it helps them in their buying decision.

{%capture hypothesis%}
I think that providing more efficiency in finding the relevant products, would improve the search experience. It would ultimately increase the user's retention and the business would also benefit from an increase in sales rates.
{%endcapture%}

{%capture solution%}
Provide a tool that users can deliberately choose between options designed to make the user experience more personal and also get better search results.

{%capture learnings%}
I really enjoyed working on this project, it made me want to continue learning more about how the Cognitive Bias and Psychology can help to create user experience and understand the user from a new point of view.
