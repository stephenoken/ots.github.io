### Why I used this methodology
To evaluate the current online e-commerce by using metric relative to the performance and understand the standards.
### Process
As a starting point, I reviewed retail websites, and I set myself the task of understanding the basics that are generally involved when people searching and buy online clothes.

For this benchmark, I applied these measures:
* Cognitive Biases 
* Patterns and Conventions 
* Usability Heuristics.




### Findings
* The e-commerce retail websites are about search products and apply filters in order to find what the user  needs.

### My hypothesis
During my desk research, I came to realize that for a relatively simple task as finding and buying a t-shirt many solutions exist across retail websites. This made me wonder how users are interacting with the different shopping experiences.
