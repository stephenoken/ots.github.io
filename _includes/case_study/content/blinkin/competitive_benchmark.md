### Why I used this methodology

Itâ€™s a easy way to gather a lot of  user data, its cheap and relatively fast .
### Process
The first step was to define the purpose of the Survey. What I want to know to form the users and to get more valuable data about the user's Needs, Thoughts, Emotions, Motivations

In order to get this data I was very thoughtful about how to ask the questions to get input I was looking for, and at the same time get quantitative and qualitative data.
### Findings
*  The Users know what they are looking for on a website.
*  The experience of searching doesn't mean anything to them
*  They know well the process to the level that is not a  challenge or  a funny thing to do.
*  They want to save time and use the tools that make the searching more fast and effective.

### My hypothesis
There's a lot of different opinions about the search process and the filters. But what about enjoying the experience?
