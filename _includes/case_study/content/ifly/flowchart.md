### Why I used this methodology
To describe the back-end process and the user task flows. To map out the website flow and stages.
### Process
The objective of this phase was to create a high level flow of the booking process. For this project, my main focus was on one primary use case. To achieve this I split the flow into more detailed tasks.

#### Tasks to complete:
Book a flight for a City break. Fly from Copenhagen to Paris from November 9th to 11th but flexible with departure dates. The trip is for two people. The flow stops before the seat selection.

### What did I find?
*  For me, this process helped me to identify the main and sub screens. It also informed me which screen the content will go on.
### My hypothesis
This step allowed me to further organize the data I collected and I was able to start designing a more concrete architecture for the booking process.
