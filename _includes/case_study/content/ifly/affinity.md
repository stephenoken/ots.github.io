### Why I used this methodology

To review all the notes and insight I gather till now to organize the research findings from a large set of ideas into clusters working in collaboration, with the goal of creating awareness of usability issues and design challenges and to gain empathy towards the users.
### Process
After obtaining the raw data from the Research phase, I began to analyse it. I enlisted someone to help me with this phase, we reviewed the data gathered, took notes on Post-It notes, and then clustered them together into groups and subgroups on a wall.
This helped me at structure to the data collected in the previous steps.

### Findings
* The main goal of the Home screen is to start the flight search. 
* Users get confused when navigating between the departure  and return screens. 
* It is important to inform if the selected flight is direct or has a layover. 
* Selecting fares is confusing and the Compare Fares screen
has too much information. 
* Giving constant feedback helps users to stay in the flow.
### My hypothesis
Working with someone else, we were able to take the unstructured data and clustered it together into a structured format and then we were able to identify logical theme patterns.
