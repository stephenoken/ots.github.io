I found the usability test to be a very useful and meaningful tool that helped me gain a better understanding of the user and their real difficulties.

I would have applied more methodologies along the research process, and the Definition Stage, such as Brainstorming, How my we?..... and a Problem Statement.

Although I have previously commented that the usability test was positive, I must admit that doing it myself was a great challenge and that it is a skill that I must practice more, to achieve greater fluency and know-how and when to get out of the script to be able to achieve more input from the user without making him feel uncomfortable.

If I were to continue working on this project, I would start doing usability tests on the final prototype from this project and begin to further refine this solution.

{%capture project_overview%}
I found that this project really highlighted to me the importance of how each stage in the process feeds into the next and how it informs my decision-making throughout the process.

It was interesting how I started with a very abstract problem of just improving the booking experience. But as I worked through the process I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the industry conventions when it comes to booking a flight through the app. I was able to identify the user goals, behaviours, pain points and context in those conventions and the actual problem to solve.  Which was a rewarding experience.
