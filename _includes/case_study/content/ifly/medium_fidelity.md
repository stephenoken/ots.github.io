### Process
With the sketches I was able to begin creating an interactive prototype of my solution.

This medium fidelity prototype focused on taking the sketches I created and making a realistic and intuitive prototype. Where you can see how the end to end booking process worked.

At this point I didn't focus on the theming or branding of the app, since I wanted to focus on building recognizable UI elements with different states.
