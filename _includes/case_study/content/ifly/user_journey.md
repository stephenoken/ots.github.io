### Why I used this methodology
To crystallize where customers get stuck or frustrated on their path to purchase and beyond. It’s a visual representation that synthesizes data on personas and user behaviour.
### Process
The purpose of the customer journey diagram was to continue shaping and structuring the data previously obtained, and to create a visualization. To achieve this, I put myself in the mind of the user and attributed their positive and negative points to each steps of the flow.

#### Tasks to complete:
From the customer journey diagram I now know the key user goals and more importantly the common pain points and mental models that prevent the user from having a smooth booking experience. They are:

* Unexpected transition between departure and return flights.
* Selecting different fare types
* Unclear information about whether the flight is direct or not.

### My hypothesis
Going through this process allowed me to understand that a user’s experience depends on their goals. These goals are not always global and each step can have its own mini goals. The mini goals can either improve or dis-improve the user’s experience.
