### Why I used this methodology

Itâ€™s an easy way to gather a lot of user data, its cheap and relatively fast .

### Process
In order to acquire more quantitative and qualitative data about the project, I ran an online survey. Using both closed-ended and open-ended questions I was able to collect useful data about user behaviour.

### Findings
*  Users prefer searching for flights on airline websites.
*  Mobile apps are typically used for checking-in.
*  Most users make short-distance trips.
*  Users associate their travel experience with the in-app experience.
### My hypothesis
This process has helped me gain insight into how users use these types of apps.
