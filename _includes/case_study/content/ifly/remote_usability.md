### Why I used this methodology
To learn about the user context, goals, behaviours. Also, to upskill how to conduct interviews and draw insights from the users.

### Process
The next logical step was to perform a usability test. To achieve this, I recruited a friend who travels by air on a regular basis and books their flight online. I conducted the test remotely.

Since I did not have an existing product but was researching for a new one, I decided to use two existing competitor apps instead. They were SAS and Norwegian apps. I prepared an in depth interview and test to be completed within one hour.

#### Tasks to complete:
Book a flight for a City break. Fly from Copenhagen to Paris from November 9th to 11th but flexible with departure dates. The trip is for two people. The flow stops before the seat selection.

### What did I find?
*  The SAS interface was less cluttered and that prevented the
flow from being interrupted.

* In the Norwegian app test, it was more challenging for the
user to book a flight. There was confusion on selecting the
flight and the fares, which were not clear. The user was
getting lost at different points in the flow.

### My hypothesis
The user had never used the SAS or Norwegian app before. But they still knew how to navigate through them. This confirms that industry conventions are well known.
