### Why I used this methodology
To gather relevant facts, for the problem statement
### Process
Review all the notes and paid attention to where the users feel the pain points.
### Findings
*  The main problems are focus on a specific stage of the flow: The flight selection.
### My hypothesis
I will need to work on a solution for that stage, but donâ€™t forget what other stages and sections may need attention.
