### Why I used this methodology

After the design and I had developed a strong framework from the lo-fi prototype and in preparation for the high fidelity prototype I need to create the UI design system in order to maintain consistency through all the experience and improve the usability.
### Process
After having a clear vision of what the website should look like I decided to create some foundations like colour palettes, typography and icons. With that having done I started to build the most important components for the website which are:

* Grid
* Buttons
* Input fields
* Flight Cards

### Conclusion
Setting up components made it fast and easy for me to create a hi-fi prototype with a consistent product styling.
