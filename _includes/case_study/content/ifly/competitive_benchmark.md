### Why I used this methodology

To compare and evaluate the current airlines' apps by using metrics relative to the performance and to understand the industry standards.

### Process
The first step in the process is to analyse how competitors are solving the booking process. I focused on three European airlines, two of which were short haul carriers and the other was a long haul carrier. I also analysed AirBnB as a travel related competitor.

### Findings
* Booking a flight is a highly structured process, where the user steps through a series of screens.
* Throughout these steps the user is required to complete specific tasks such as selecting dates and filling out passenger forms.

### My hypothesis
Across the airline industry there is a well-defined process for booking flights, so breaking that convention could backfire.
