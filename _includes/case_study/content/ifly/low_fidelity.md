### Process
At this point I began to develop a solution to the problem. This involved creating sketches of the screens that would form part of my solution. To achieve the initial design I followed the methodology below:

1. Using the flow diagram I identified the key screens I needed to
design.
2. Create a list of key features for each screen.
3. I focused on a single screen, where I put the user goal first.  
Then I took the feature list and sorted it by priority to achieve
that goal.
4. With these criteria  I made several variations that tried to solve
this problem.
5. I reviewed each of these variations, and I selected the one that
best satisfies the user goal. And making sure that I included all
the key features.
6. Once I identified the best sketch for each screen. I brought
the sketches together to validate that the solution satisfies
the user’s end goal of booking a flight.

### My hypothesis
By listing the key features and the user’s goal for each section, I was able to design UI elements that have purpose in mind.
