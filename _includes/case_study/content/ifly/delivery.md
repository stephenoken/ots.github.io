### Why have I used this methodology
This was the final project for my UX course. The focus here was to create a handover document that provided detailed information to the software engineers and other stakeholders on how to build this solution.
### Process
This was the last project I had to do for the course. In it I included extra information, such as the states of the buttons and form. Also extra to help navigate within the figma file, as well as font and color systems. --For its development I had to detail all the information to hand over to the developers.

### Conclusion
To develop this wireframe I had to go through the entire flow. It was useful to reflect on the work and see what could be further improved.
