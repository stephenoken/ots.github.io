### Why I used this methodology

To take notes to highlight the key insights observed, during the session and watching the recording. Also to create a bank of insights for the next stages.
### Process
During this phase, I reviewed the usability test I recorded. My mission was take the most detailed notes a possible, focusing on, built the user empathy detecting the:
* Needs, emotions, thougts,motivations, what said and what do.

And also the userâ€™s:
* Goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.
### Findings
*  What they are unable to find on your site.
*  What is missing from your site.
*  What is unclear or vague.
*  What is causing friction or preventing them from converting.
### My hypothesis
The selection of both the flight and the type of fare is a major pain point for the user.{%endcapture%}

I don\'t know why that would happen. Because I want, I don\'t know why that has happened."|

"The select button didn\'t actually pop out visually because it is the same colours as the other menus, so that is maybe why I miss it. I didn\'t realize I had to do an extra step to select my flights."
